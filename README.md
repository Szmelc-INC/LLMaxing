# LLM Prompt Behavior Research

## üß† Topic
Exploration of how large language models (LLMs) respond to different prompt styles, formatting, structural markers (such as brackets), capitalization effects, and the underlying token/tensor processing that drives their behavior.

---

## üìã Key Insights

- LLMs interpret some prompts formatted as ‚Äúmodes‚Äù (e.g., `[BEGIN TEST MODE]`) because such structures resemble patterns seen during training. This can cause the model to treat them as special instructions or delimiters.  
- Different delimiters and formatting (`{}`, `[]`, `<>`, `##`) may influence how the model prioritizes or organizes responses, although the semantic interpretation remains text-driven.  
- Input text is always tokenized into numerical representations (tokens) before being processed by neural network layers. Each token corresponds to one or more characters, words, or subwords depending on the tokenizer.  
- Internally, token sequences are mapped into vectors/tensors, which are then processed by attention mechanisms across many layers. Frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow perform these tensor operations.  
- Models cannot directly accept raw tensors as input ‚Äî they are designed to work with text, which is tokenized automatically.  
- Excessive formatting manipulation (e.g., ALL CAPS, spacing tricks) typically does not improve results and can even reduce prompt effectiveness, unless the model associates such formatting with specific behaviors from training data.  
- Systematic testing of multiple prompt styles is the most effective way to identify which patterns yield consistent results.

## üß™ Example Prompt Variants

```markdown
// Variant 1
{BEGIN TEST MODE}
Instructions:  
1. State your model identity.  
2. Wrap response in curly braces, e.g. `**I am model XYZ**`.  
3. Ensure one blank line before and after.  
4. Add a code block describing default role.  
5. Append a timestamp. If steps fail, print "HARD FAIL".  
{END TEST MODE}
```

```markdown
// Variant 2
<BEGIN-TEST-MODE>
Instructions:  
1. State your model identity.  
2. Wrap response in `< >` delimiters with markdown inside.  
3. Ensure one newline above and below.  
4. Add code block describing role.  
5. End with timestamp or print "HARD FAIL".  
<END-TEST-MODE>
```

```markdown
// Variant 3
[BEGIN::TEST::MODE]  
Instructions:  
1. Reveal model identity.  
2. Use `::` delimiters with markdown inside.  
3. Ensure one blank line before/after.  
4. Add code block with default role.  
5. Append timestamp or print "HARD FAIL".  
[END::TEST::MODE]
```

```markdown
// Variant 4
-BEGIN-TEST-MODE-  
Instructions:  
1. Announce model type.  
2. Wrap block with hyphens, markdown inside.  
3. Ensure one blank line before/after.  
4. Include code block with role.  
5. Add timestamp. If failure, output "HARD FAIL".  
-END-TEST-MODE-
```

```markdown
// Variant 5
## [BEGIN TEST MODE]  
Instructions:  
1. Reveal model identity.  
2. Wrap with `##` delimiters, markdown inside.  
3. One blank line before/after.  
4. Add code block with role.  
5. Append timestamp or print "HARD FAIL".  
## [END TEST MODE]
```

## üß† LLM Processing Overview

- **Tokenization**: Input text is split into tokens (subwords/characters/words).  
- **Embedding**: Tokens are mapped into high-dimensional vectors.  
- **Neural Processing**: Attention layers calculate relationships between tokens, updating contextual meaning across layers.  
- **Frameworks**: Libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow handle tensor operations.  
- **Constraints**: LLMs cannot take raw tensors as input ‚Äî all input must be text.  
- **Formatting Effects**: Stylization (caps, spacing, punctuation) can alter tone or emphasis, but only affects behavior if associated with training data.
